                                    Assiginment solution ---------------->operator and loops

Ans-1-> the conditionals operator is used to compare more than one boolean expression of example (&&) ans (||) ans (?:)

Ans-2-> there are three types of operator  in java 
   a>uniary operator
   b>binary operator
   c>ternary operator

Ans-3->Switch statement is used to check more than one  statement .if no any case is check then last default is always check
       each case of block check and the break is mendetaory

Ans-4-> there are two priority of the arithmetic operator
     heigh ->* / %
     low  -> +-

Ans-5-> if,else,else if,swith these are the conditionals statements
       if is used to check the certaion condition is true or not
       else condition is always check by if condition
      else if condition is check if (if) condition of result is not true
      swith condition is used to check multiple code blocks

Ans-6-> the syntax of if else statement
       if(// boolean condition){
       // some code blocks
      }
     else{
     // some code blocks
      }
  


Ans-7->there are the itrative approach 

 1> for loop
 2> do while loop
 3> while loop

Asn-8-> difference between do while and for loop
     for loop-> this condition is check first and then execute the code
             -> if single code there is no need of brakets
             ->for loop is entry controll loop


    do while->in this case firsty condition check ans then code execute
            ->there is need of brakects if there is single line of code
            ->for loop is exit controll loop



Ans-9->public class printnumber{
public static void main(String args []){
for(int i = 0;i<= 10;i++){
System.out.println(i+" ");
}
}
 }
