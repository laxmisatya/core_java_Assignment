                                      Assignment solution --------->Array and oject

Arrays---------------->

Ans-1-> byte,short,int,long = 0
        float,dobble = 0.0
         boolean = false
         Any obect = null

Ans-2->No,we can not pass negative index to the array so,it result negativeindxexception

Ans-3->Arrays is obect in java so it store memory in heap

Ans-4->Arrays is static data structure
      ->Array store homogenious data struture
      -> size of the array is limited

Ans-5->Anonymous array is that type of array in which we can not assign the name
       for example = new int{1,2,4,5,6,7};

Ans-6-> using for loop
        using for each loop

Ans-7->the difference between length ans length() is that length  function is used for to find the length of array 
       and length() function is used to find the length of the String
      for example->
              int arr[]= {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
             System.out.println(arr.length);// output => 7

             String s = "Nikhil";
             System.out.println(s,length());// output=>6



object oriented programming----------------->


Ans-1-> class is a blueprint in which all the data and method is define and in main we are create the object for accesing the 
         method and data 
         for example--> creation of the object
                     class_name name = new class_name();

Ans-2->new keyword is used to create the object by which it allocate memory to object and new keyword is also 
       used to create the constructor
 
Ans-3-> there are three types of variable in java
       static variable
       local variable
       instance variable

Ans-4-> instance variable is create in the class
        without creation of object we can not able to access the data
        memory of instance variable is stored on heap
        it includes access modifier such as public private and protected
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
       local variable is created in the block method 
       it has no need of creation of the obeject for accessing direct access is possible
       memory of the locacal variable stored on the stack
       it does not includes access modifier such as public private and protected

Ans-5->Instence variable of memory allocate on heap and local variable locate on the stack


Ans-6-> method overloading is the concept in which we overload the method by same name and same return type
        but different(or same) types of argument, by this concept is code readibility is easy to understand
